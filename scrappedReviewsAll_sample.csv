99,I got this during the holiday sale as a gift for my mom! She absolutely loves it.
100,Thank you!!! I really appreciate you shipping it as soon as possible and understand that int’l mail (and mail in general) can take a little while. I love this ring so much. (I AM IN LOVE WITH THE CLAM RING BOX BTW.)

116,"Schmaler, schlichter Ring, aber perfekt zum Kombinieren!"
117,Das Armband ist super. Gute Qualität und die Bestellung/Lieferung unkompliziert und schnell.
118,Thank you for all your help
119,Super schöner Ring in hübscher Verpackung. Alles super geklappt;)
120,Thank you these earrings are beautiful
121,"Lovely earrings, fast shipping.  Sent as a gift to a friend - she loved them."
122,A great bracelet. Very please with how quickly it was sent
123,So I finally received my bracelet. It is perfect. Because of where the seller lives expect long shipping times. It took over a month to get my bracelet and the packaging had been destroyed (by customs I’m assuming since it had been opened and then taped back shut). Had I known it would be over a month to receive the ashes bracelet I would have gotten something else and not make the funeral home wait that long.
124,"My 17 year old daughter is very happy with the ring. She wears it on her middle finger, it was a little bit to wide for her ring finger."
125,"Also for my 17 year old daughter, very happy!!"
126,Very pretty! Thank you!
127,"Fast shipment, and good quality."
128,Did not receive it and it’s March 4
129,"I absolutely love this one-of-a-kind piece!  Perfect for the minimalist! Shipping was fast (to Hawai’i), item is exactly as shown in the picture.  It’s so cute on; I’m in love with it."
130,"I really like them but difficult to put on. Hard to see/feel for the required hole on back of jacket. There are three holes and I need the shortest. Trying to hold jacket, post and then put back on with fingernails is challenging. I do love the look tho! Will keep practicing!"
131,"I love them! So beautiful and I got any compliments :)
Thank you!"
132,"Wow, they're just like the picture. So wonderfully minimal, you can wear them and match them to any gold jewellery. Or they are just perfect as standalones cause they are still noticeable 🌞"
133,Love all of the jewelry here each time that I have ordered from here it has always been a hit!
134,Absolutely perfect! Such a unique design. New favorites!

149,"Both pieces swivels, which I wasn't expecting. Otherwise it's great."
150,the grooves to adjust the distance between the bottom and top bar is awesome but the shortest setting was still too loose. amazing concept but be wary for small ear lobed people!
151,Definitly thought these were good b/c of the picture. They’re silver.
152,"The earrings are difficult to put on, the three homes for the post are hard to get right for both ears. Really nice once you get them on but it takes a while."
153,Love everything I've purchased from this shop. Bought this as a gift and hit was very happily received!
154,They are super cute. They did not fit my ear lobe shape great but I gifted them to a friend and they look STUNNING on her
155,I got these as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and they look great on him! He loved them. I'm getting another pair for myself (this time with the bar instead of the ball) and I can't wait for them to arrive :)
156,"Super unique, high quality, would buy again!"
